# 🧠 Tumor Prediction using Explainable AI (XAI)

This project leverages a CNN-based deep learning model using **PyTorch** and **VGG16** to classify brain tumor MRI images into 4 types with **97% accuracy**. It incorporates **Grad-CAM** for model interpretability by generating class-specific heatmaps over tumor regions.

The dataset is structured using `ImageFolder` format with 4 classes and two sets:

```yaml
Tumor Dataset:
  Training:
    - glioma
    - meningioma
    - pituitary
    - notumor
  Testing:
    - glioma
    - meningioma
    - pituitary
    - notumor
```

Each subfolder contains MRI images representing its respective class.
